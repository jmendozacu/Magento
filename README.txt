The Magento plugin extends Z-Ray to display all the Magento elements constructing your eCommerce applications. Using Z-Ray, you’ll be able to profile loaded blocks, modules, triggered events and observers, all the various Magento handles, and see additional useful information on the request and application.
The Magento plugin also defines the routing logic for Magento requests - for better events aggregation in Zend Server, and improved results for URLs in URL Insight.
